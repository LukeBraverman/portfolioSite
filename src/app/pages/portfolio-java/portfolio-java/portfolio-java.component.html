      During my professional journey in both the banking sector and startups,
      I leveraged core Java, the Spring Boot framework, and J2EE to craft effective solutions for clients.
      In the realm of backend development, I adopted Docker and Kubernetes for efficient packaging and
      building of code, ensuring seamless delivery to our clients. Additionally, all code was hosted
      on the robust infrastructure of Microsoft Azure. This technological stack not only empowered our
      solutions but also ensured a scalable and reliable environment for our clients' needs.
